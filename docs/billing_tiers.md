## Mock verification in development

Use the mock billing endpoint to simulate upgrades when running the backend locally.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/billing/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"dev-user","platform":"ios","receipt":"PRO-XYZ"}'
```

Use a receipt beginning with `PRO-` to upgrade to Pro or `ELITE-` for Elite. Any other receipt leaves the user on Free.

The server persists billing state in the JSON file configured by the `BILLING_STORE_PATH` environment variable (defaults to `data/users.json`).

## How to test the Upgrade screen (mock)

1. Start the FastAPI server locally so `/billing/status` and `/billing/verify` are reachable from the web client or Expo app.
2. Open the web client (`web/index.html`) and switch to the **Upgrade** tab, or navigate to the **Upgrade** screen from the mobile app home.
3. Enter a mock receipt:
   - `PRO-*` values unlock the Pro tier.
   - `ELITE-*` values unlock the Elite tier.
4. Submit the form. The client calls `POST /billing/verify` with the active `userId` and then refreshes `GET /billing/status` to update gates immediately.
5. Return to the home viewâ€”coach personas unlock and AR Target Precision is no longer gated for upgraded tiers.

Receipts and tiers are cached on the client after a successful verification so gates stay open until the mock store resets.
